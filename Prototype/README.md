# Leveling the Playing Field

![Platform Banner](images/banner.png)

**Leveling the Playing Field** is a prototype platform designed to help game developers identify stereotypes early in the design process. Inspired by community-driven platforms like Discord and Reddit, it provides structured spaces where designers and reviewers collaborate to create inclusive, stereotype-free games.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a **dedicated platform** where:
- **Developers** post game assets (characters, scripts, designs).
- **Reviewers** provide structured feedback on stereotypes and representation.
- **Studios** can incentivize quality feedback through **paid reviews**.

## 🖼️ Platform Views

The platform has three main views:

1. **Designer/Developer View** – For posting content, managing channels, and inviting reviewers.
