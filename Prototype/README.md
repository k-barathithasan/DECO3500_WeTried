# Leveling the Playing Field

Leveling
 
the
 
Playing
 
Field
 
 
To
 
address
 
the
 
challenge
 
of
 
enabling
 
developers
 
to
 
identify
 
stereotypes
 
early
 
in
 
the
 
design
 
process,
 
we
 
propose
 
the
 
creation
 
of
 
a
 
dedicated
 
platform/website,
 
inspired
 
by
 
community-driven
 
spaces
 
such
 
as
 
Discord
 
or
 
Reddit.
 
Instead
 
of
 
relying
 
on
 
the
 
recruitment
 
of
 
individual
 
playtesters,
 
this
 
platform
 
would
 
provide
 
a
 
structured
 
space
 
where
 
designers
 
and
 
developers
 
can
 
post
 
content,
 
such
 
as
 
game
 
characters,
 
story
 
scripts,
 
or
 
design
 
elements,
 
for
 
review
 
and
 
feedback
 
specifically
 
related
 
to
 
stereotypes,
 
inclusivity ,
 
and
 
representation.
 
Each
 
post
 
would
 
be
 
published
 
within
 
a
 
channel
 
created
 
by
 
the
 
developer/designer
 
for
 
their
 
specific
 
game.
 
This
 
allows
 
studios
 
to
 
organize
 
discussions
 
by
 
project
 
and
 
ensure
 
targeted
 
feedback.
 
Reviewers
 
can
 
then
 
join
 
these
 
channels
 
and
 
provide
 
their
 
input,
 
either
 
through
 
public
 
access
 
links
 
or
 
direct
 
invitations
 
from
 
the
 
developers.
 
A
 
key
 
feature
 
of
 
the
 
platform
 
is
 
its
 
reviewer
 
ecosystem.
 
Studios
 
can
 
discover
 
reviewers
 
from
 
within
 
the
 
platform,
 
invite
 
them
 
into
 
their
 
channels,
 
and
 
engage
 
directly
 
with
 
their
 
feedback.
 
To
 
support
 
sustainability
 
and
 
incentivize
 
quality
 
input,
 
reviewers
 
will
 
be
 
compensated
 
by
 
the
 
studios
 
for
 
their
 
contributions.
 
The
 
platform
 
is
 
designed
 
with
 
three
 
distinct
 
views:
 
1.
 
Designer/Developer
 
View
 
-
 
For
 
creating
 
channels,
 
posting
 
content,
 
and
 
managing
 
reviewer
 
engagement.
 
 
2.
 
Reviewer
 
View
 
-
 
For
 
browsing
 
available
 
channels,
 
joining
 
discussions,
 
and
 
providing
 
structured
 
feedback.
 
 
3.
 
Landing
 
Hub
 
-
 
First
 
page
 
a
 
user
 
sees
 
after
 
signing
 
in,
 
where
 
they
 
can
 
either
 
accept
 
invitation
 
links
 
to
 
become
 
a
 
Reviewer
 
by
 
agreeing
 
to
 
channel-specific
 
terms
 
and
 
conditions
 
or
 
simply
 
browse
 
public
 
posts
 
shared
 
by
 
game
 
studios.
 
This
 
page
 
ensures
 
flexibility
 
by
 
allowing
 
users
 
to
 
choose
 
between
 
actively
 
contributing
 
as
 
a
 
paid
 
reviewer
 
or
 
passively
 
exploring
 
ongoing
 
projects
 
and
 
discussions.
 
 
 
 

Designer/Developer
 
Platform
 
When
 
a
 
designer
 
or
 
developer
 
accesses
 
the
 
platform
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
the
 
primary
 
call-to-action
 
(CTA)
 
displayed
 
in
 
the
 
top
 
navigation
 
bar
 
is
 
“Add
 
Post.”
 
This
 
feature
 
enables
 
them
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
post,
 
and
 
during
 
this
 
flow,
 
the
 
platform
 
prompts
 
them
 
to
 
also
 
create
 
a
 
new
 
channel
 
for
 
the
 
game.
 
The
 
newly
 
created
 
post
 
is
 
then
 
published
 
within
 
the
 
associated
 
channel.
 
The
 
platform
 
interface
 
for
 
designers/developers
 
is
 
structured
 
around
 
the
 
following
 
key
 
components:
