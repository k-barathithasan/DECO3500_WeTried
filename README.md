## 🌐 Domain

**Theme:** Sexism and Stereotypes in Video Games  
**User Group:** Game Developers and Designers  

### Domain Definition

We are working with game developers and designers in storyline and quest design within games to create opportunities for reducing stereotypes, avoiding sexualisation, and promoting inclusive representation through the use of social and contextual computing.

#### Key Domain Characteristics
- **🎯 Focus on Game Developers and Designers:** Professionals who create and shape video games, engaging in structured workflows and creative processes.  
- **🚫 Impact of Gender Stereotypes and Sexism:** Explores how biased perceptions and discriminatory norms influence design choices, character representations, and narrative structures.  
- **🗨️ Normalised Sexist Discourse:** Highlights how gendered jokes, memes, and workplace norms subtly reinforce stereotypes within development teams and design practices.

## 🧭 Project Overview

Gaming is a powerful storytelling platform that shapes how players see themselves and others. However, despite its influence, gaming continues to reflect gender inequality and deep-rooted stereotypes. Many development workflows still lack the tools or perspectives to identify and address bias early in the process.  

**FairFrame** aims to close this gap by creating a **collaborative review platform** where designers and everyday players can upload game characters and narratives for inclusive feedback. The system promotes dialogue between developers and audiences, encouraging fairness, empathy, and cultural awareness in design decisions.  

By fostering shared discussions, FairFrame provides developers with actionable insights to build characters and stories that are **representative, inclusive, and free from stereotypes**.
