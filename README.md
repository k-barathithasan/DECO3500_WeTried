## 🌐 Domain

**Theme:** Sexism and Stereotypes in Video Games  
**User Group:** Game Developers and Designers  

### Domain Definition

We are working with game developers and designers in storyline and quest design within games to create opportunities for reducing stereotypes, avoiding sexualisation, and promoting inclusive representation through the use of social and contextual computing.

#### Key Domain Characteristics
- **🎯 Focus on Game Developers and Designers:** Professionals who create and shape video games, engaging in structured workflows and creative processes.  
- **🚫 Impact of Gender Stereotypes and Sexism:** Explores how biased perceptions and discriminatory norms influence design choices, character representations, and narrative structures.  
- **🗨️ Normalised Sexist Discourse:** Highlights how gendered jokes, memes, and workplace norms subtly reinforce stereotypes within development teams and design practices.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

Gaming is a powerful storytelling platform that shapes how players see themselves and others. However, despite its influence, gaming continues to reflect gender inequality and deep-rooted stereotypes. Many development workflows still lack the tools or perspectives to identify and address bias early in the process.  

**FairFrame** aims to close this gap by creating a **collaborative review platform** where designers and everyday players can upload game characters and narratives for inclusive feedback. The system promotes dialogue between developers and audiences, encouraging fairness, empathy, and cultural awareness in design decisions.  

By fostering shared discussions, FairFrame provides developers with actionable insights to build characters and stories that are **representative, inclusive, and free from stereotypes**.

## ✅ Proof of Concept

**FairFrame** is an interactive proof of concept that balances simulation and core functionality to demonstrate how collaborative feedback can improve inclusive character design in games.

**What it shows**
* Designers and players share character concepts and scripts for feedback.
* Reviewers add comments on posts or open a drawing board to annotate designs and switch pen colours.
* Reputation is demonstrated through giving badges and viewing badge history and reviewer profiles.
* Discussion channels and community boards keep conversations organised and visible to the whole group.

**How it reflects social computing**
* Collaboration and awareness: shared boards, visible comments, and badges make contribution and activity easy to see.
* Community norms: badges reward constructive behaviour and support fair participation.
* Inclusivity focus: prompts and flows foreground respectful, diverse feedback.

**Scope and limits of this build**
* Login accepts any email format and a password with at least 6 characters.
* Data is mocked in the front end and does not persist between sessions.
* Features are implemented to illustrate flows and interactions rather than provide production systems.


### 💻 How to Run the Prototype

1. **Open the project folder** in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).  
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (if not already installed).  
3. **Right-click** on `index.html` → select **“Open with Live Server.”**  
4. The prototype will open automatically in your browser.  

**Login Instructions:**  
- Use any **valid email format** (e.g., `test@example.com`).  
- Enter **any password with at least 6 characters**.  
- The prototype will load the main interface (no real account required).
